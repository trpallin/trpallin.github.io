Hello, this is the first post on my blog.

My name is Junil, and I live in Vancouver, Canada.

I moved here from South Korea because I was just curious about how life in North America would be different from my country. Embracing the idea of “just do it”, I obtained an open work permit for Canada and made the move (4 months from first thought to arriving at Vancouver airport). I have worked as a Software Engineer, and now I’m trying to find a job in this city.

I created this blog to document my thoughts and life ~~and to improve my English~~. I love sports, PC games, reading, programming and many Computer Science things. My biggest interest recently has been **“how to survive in this competitive job market as a foreign worker.”** 😎

Thank you for visiting. I hope to see you again!
